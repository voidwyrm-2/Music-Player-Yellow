# Music Player Yellow
A music player made with pygame that's actually pretty good


In order to specify the place where the program looks for files, make a .txt file in the same place as musicplayeryellow.py and put the path to the folder in there


## Controls
* escape: exit
* W/arrow up and S/arrow down: switch selected file
* F/G/H: play, pause/unpause, stop, respectively
* Z/X: turn on/off search mode

### Search mode
Search mode is exactly what it sounds like

type in the file number, and hit enter or t



(if you get the reference of the name and icon, then some say typing a certain *revolver-wielding character's* name in search mode might do something special)
