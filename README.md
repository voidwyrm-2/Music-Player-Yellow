# Music Player Yellow
A music player made with pygame that's actually pretty good


In order to specify the place where the program looks for files, make a file named "filepath.txt" in the same place as musicplayeryellow.py and put the path to the folder in there



## Controls
* escape: exit the program

* W/arrow up and S/arrow down: switch selected file
* F/G/H: play, pause/unpause, stop, respectively
* O/P: turn on/off playing next in queue automatically
* N: skip current song and play next in queue(on by default)
* Q: turn on/off search mode
* K: turn on/off queue mode
* R: reload files list(for if you changed filepath.txt while the program is running)



### Search mode
Search mode is exactly what it sounds like<br>
Type in the file number, and hit enter

### Queue mode
Queue mode is search mode, but instead of changing the current song, it's added to a queue

(some say typing a certain *revolver-wielding character's* name in search mode might do something special)

# DISCLAIMER
I have **no relation whatsoever** to the Undertale Yellow team, I just really like the game's music and felt the need to make this music player

The Undertale Yellow team is the owner of Clover and Undertale Yellow and I simply just traced the character(Clover) for this
