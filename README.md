# Music Player Yellow
A music player made with pygame that's actually pretty good


In order to specify the place where the program looks for files, make a .txt file in the same place as musicplayeryellow.py and put the path to the folder in there


## Controls
* escape: exit the program
* W/arrow up and S/arrow down: switch selected file
* F/G/H: play, pause/unpause, stop, respectively
* Q: turn on/off search mode
* K: turn on/off queue mode
* R: reload files list(for if you changed filepath.txt while the program is running)

### Search mode
Search mode is exactly what it sounds like

Type in the file number, and hit enter

### Queue mode
Queue mode is search mode, but instead of changing the current song, you can queue up another

You can only queue up one song at a time, however


(if you get the reference of the name and icon, then some say typing a certain *revolver-wielding character's* name in search mode might do something special)



# DISCLAIMER
I have no relation whatsoever to the Undertale Yellow team, I just really like the game's music and felt the need to make this music player

The Undertale Yellow team is the owner of Clover and Undertale Yellow and I simply just traced the character(Clover) for this
